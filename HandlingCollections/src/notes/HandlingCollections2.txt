Two component available in java to store more than one value under a single variable.
-->  Array       -- Static data structure
-->  Collections -- Dynamic data structure


-->Map
   Map is one of the interface.
   Map is a component of collections.
   Map is a parent class for Hash Map, Linked Hash Map, Tree Map, Hash Table.
   In Map the data will be store on the basis of key and key value.
   We can store only one value under one key.
   If two different value is assigned to one key value then it will override the latest value.
   
 -->Key & key set  Value & value set
    Key is store a value in map.
    Value is a data corresponding to the key.
    Collection of key is called key set.
    Collection of value is called value set.
    
-->What is entry & entry set
   Key and key value is called entry (Key and key value together make an entry in the memory).
   All the key and key value is called entry set.
   
-->Set 
   In map we can't use iterator directly.
   To call a set of data we can use set to iterator the value.
 
-->Methods
    List   -- Random order.
    Linked -- Insertion order.
    Tree   -- Ascending order / descending order. 
-->Hash
   Hash class is print the data in random order.
   
-->Hash table
   Hash table will not accept null values whereas other child class of map will accept null values.
   By default it will print the data in the insertion order.
   
-->Hints
   TC_ID and data.
   
 -->Difference between hash table and map
    Hash table is synchronized.
    Hash table will not accept null values whereas other child class of map will accept null values.
    Hash table consume more time to execute whereas other three take less time to execute.
